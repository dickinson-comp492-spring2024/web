# Attendance

As stated on the syllabus, the course centers around the capstone
project and discussion sessions. These activities are meaningful only
if students are present to interact with other students and the
instructor. Therefore, attendance is required at all classes and is a
graded component of the course.

Attendance is worth 5% of the final grade, computed as follows:

| number of unexcused absences | attendance score        |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| 0-2                          | 5%                       |
| 3                            | 4%                       |
| 4                            | 3%                       |
| 5                            | 2%                       |
| 6                            | 1%                       |
| 7                            | 0%                       |

* Please do not come to class if you are sick. The instructor will
  always grant you an excused absence if you have a genuine
  illness. If you are unwell, notify the instructor in a timely
  fashion, giving as much advance notice as possible before the class.
  - The instructor may ask you to complete an additional assignment to
    make up for an excused absence. [Added 9/20/2023]
