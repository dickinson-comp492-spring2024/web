# Assignments for COMP492


## Overview of the capstone project

The most significant component of COMP492 is the continuation of the
capstone project started in COMP491. As is usual for
COMP491/492, some students work in teams on contributions to a
large-scale pre-existing open-source project; others work individually
on a research project.

The goals for the project are the same as for COMP491:
* For open-source projects, the goal is to make meaningful
  contributions to the upstream project, which can include:
  documentation improvements, bug gardening, bug fixes, commenting on
  issues, resolutions of issues, and any other contributions. It is
  highly desirable to have contributions accepted by the upstream
  project maintainers, but it is also possible for a capstone
  project to succeed in many other ways.
* For research projects, the goal is to produce empirical and/or
  theoretical results that address the research question.

In all cases, grading of assignments related to the capstone
project will take into account demonstrated effort as well as concrete
achievements. This principle applies to 5-15 reports, the checkpoint
presentation, the poster presentation and the final presentation. The
best way to demonstrate effort is to maintain a detailed and regular
Slack live-log, as described next.

## Slack live-logs

A Slack live-log is a Slack channel that will be used to assess effort
invested in the capstone project. Its primary
purpose is as a detailed diary to show the instructor when you have
been working on which tasks. It is recommended that you log some kind
of message every hour while working. Typically, you would
describe in 1-2 sentences what you achieved in the last hour and
what you are planning to do in the next hour.

## Build something fun (BSF)

One important goal of working on software or research projects is to
build something fun and enjoy doing it. With that in mind, you are
invited to spend part of this semester on any creative project that is
relevant to your chosen open source or research project. This is
called the *BSF* (Build Something Fun) component for your project. The
BSF component is optional. You are also welcome to continue on
standard contributions such as pull requests for Issues on your
project's Issue Tracker. Choosing to work on a BSF component will not
change your grade. You are still expected to devote the same amount of
effort to your project, whether continuing to work on Issues, or
spending time on a BSF component. 

### When can I start the BSF?

It is important to have reached a
satisfactory level of standard contributions to your capstone project
before beginning on the BSF. In most cases, it is not possible to begin the BSF until the second half of the semester, after spring break. You must consult with the instructor to
determine whether your team can begin on a BSF. Once you have
permission to begin the BSF component, the instructor may also require
you to continue work on standard contributions. Please communicate
frequently with the instructor to ensure that your project is on a
successful track, with a good balance between standard contributions
and BSF.

### What could my BSF be?

You can work on the BSF as an individual, in a small sub-team, or as an
entire team. You could build a small webpage or demo that is based on
your project, or maybe some new content related to your project. It
could be a crazy new feature that wasn't requested by the
maintainers. You could create something artistic that will look good
in your final presentation. Feel free to pitch any and all ideas to
the instructor. Please continue to log your efforts in the Slack live
log.
