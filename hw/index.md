## New optional fun twist to senior seminar project

One important goal of working on software or research projects is to
build something fun and enjoy doing it. With that in mind, you are
invited to spend the last few weeks of the semester on any creative
project whatsoever that is relevant to your chosen open source or
research project. This is called the *fun twist* for your project. The
fun twist is optional. You are also welcome to continue on standard
contributions such as pull requests for Issues on your project's Issue
Tracker. Choosing to work on a fun twist will not change your
grade. You are still expected to devote the same amount of effort to
your project, whether continuing to work on Issues, or spending time
on a creative fun twist.

### What could my fun twist be?

You can work on this as an individual, in a small sub-team, or as an
entire team. You could build a small webpage or demo that is based on
your project, or maybe some new content related to your project. It
could be a crazy new feature that wasn't requested by the
maintainers. You could create something artistic that will look good
in your final presentation. Feel free to pitch any and all ideas to
the instructor. Please continue to log your efforts in the Slack live
log.

## Overview of the senior seminar project

The most significant component of COMP492 is the continuation of the
senior seminar project started in COMP491. As is usual for
COMP491/492, some students work in teams on contributions to a
large-scale pre-existing open-source project; others work individually
on a research project.

The goals for the project are the same as for COMP491:
* For open-source projects, the goal is to make meaningful
  contributions to the upstream project, which can include:
  documentation improvements, bug gardening, bug fixes, commenting on
  issues, resolutions of issues, and any other contributions. It is
  highly desirable to have contributions accepted by the upstream
  project maintainers, but it is also possible for a senior seminar
  project to succeed in many other ways.
* For research projects, the goal is to produce empirical and/or
  theoretical results that address the research question.

In all cases, grading of assignments related to the senior seminar
project will take into account demonstrated effort as well as concrete
achievements. This principle applies to 5-15 reports, the checkpoint
presentation, the poster presentation and the final presentation. The
best way to demonstrate effort is to maintain a detailed and regular
Slack live-log, as described next.

## Slack live-logs

A Slack live-log is a Slack channel that will be used to assess effort
invested in the senior seminar project. You may also use the same
channel for communication among your team members, but its primary
purpose is as a detailed diary to show the instructor when you have
been working on which tasks. It is recommended that you log some kind
of message every 30 minutes while working. Typically, you would
describe in 1-2 sentences what you achieved in the last 30 minutes and
what you are planning to do in the next 30 minutes.
